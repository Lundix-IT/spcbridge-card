# spcbridge-card
## Introduction
This is a Lovelace card for Home Assistant that can be used to control your acre/Vanderbilt SPC alarm system.

The card works on top of the [spcbridge custom component](https://github.com/Lundix-IT/spcbridge). You *will* need it as well.

You cannot use it with any other alarm integration in HA.
